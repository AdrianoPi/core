Introduction
===================================

NeuRome is a `discrete event simulation (DES) <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete-event_simulation>`_ runtime environment written in C17.
To ease the process of developing a DES model, NeuRome provides you with a simple but powerful C API.
You can then compile your model by using Neurome's wrapper. The resulting executable can be deployed on desktop computer as well as computational clusters.
