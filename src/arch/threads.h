 * @brief Portable C11 Thread Implementation
 *
 * This is a C11-mostly-compliant version of threading support targeting both
 * POSIX and Windows systems.
 * It is heavily based on Tiny C Threads, which sources have been slightly modified
 * to account for ROOT-Sim's code base, and to slightly improve the performance
 * of some primitive.
